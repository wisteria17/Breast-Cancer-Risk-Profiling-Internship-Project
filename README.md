# Breast-Cancer-Risk-Profiling-Internship-Project
Breast Cancer Risk Profiling
Internship Project - Edunet Foundation
Project Overview
This project aims to segment women based on their breast cancer risk factors using Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The goal is to provide personalized healthcare recommendations by analyzing user inputs and identifying risk levels.

Features
âœ… Real-time Risk Profiling â€“ Users receive a dynamic risk score (percentage-based) rather than just categories.
âœ… Interactive User Interface â€“ Users can input health-related data and receive a detailed analysis.
âœ… Personalized Recommendations â€“ Health tips are generated based on individual risk factors.
âœ… Data Clustering â€“ Advanced machine learning techniques (Hierarchical Clustering & GMM) group users based on risk factors.
âœ… Retake Option â€“ Users can change their answers without refreshing the page.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frameworks: Flask (for backend), React (for frontend)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn for risk distribution and clustering results
Data & Methodology
The model considers multiple risk factors, including:

Age
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Hormonal Influences (e.g., birth control, hormone therapy)
Family History of Breast Cancer
Lifestyle Factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, stress levels)
The data is processed using Hierarchical Clustering to explore natural groupings and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to provide probabilistic risk assessments.

How It Works
Users input their health data into the interface.
The system applies clustering models to classify users into risk groups.
A real-time risk score (percentage-based) is displayed.
The system generates personalized health recommendations based on the results.
Graphs & Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations, such as:
ðŸ“Š Data Distribution Graphs â€“ Show how risk factors are spread across the dataset.
ðŸ“ˆ Clustering Results â€“ Scatter plots showing how users are grouped into different risk levels.
ðŸ“‰ Risk Score Distribution â€“ Histograms displaying the range of risk percentages.
ðŸ“Œ Feature Importance â€“ Bar charts highlighting the most influential risk factors.

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ More Risk Factors â€“ Incorporate genetic predisposition and diet-related factors.
ðŸ”¹ Mobile-Friendly UI â€“ Improve accessibility on mobile devices.
ðŸ”¹ Integration with Healthcare APIs â€“ Provide real-world medical insights.
